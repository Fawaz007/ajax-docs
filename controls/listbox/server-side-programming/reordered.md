# Reordered

## 

The **Reordered** event fires after the [Updated]({%slug listbox/server-side-programming/server-events/updated%}) event. The **Items** collection of the listbox is updated to reflect the reordering.

The event handler receives two parameters:

1. The instance of the listbox firing the event

2. An event arguments parameter containing the following property:

* **Items** - collection of **RadListBoxItem** objects which were reordered.


````C#
protected void RadListBox1_Reordered(object sender, RadListBoxEventArgs e)
{
	foreach (RadListBoxItem item in e.Items)
	{
		item.Text = "Reordered Item";
	}
}
````
````VB.NET
Protected Sub RadListBox1_Reordered(sender As Object, e As RadListBoxEventArgs)
	For Each item As RadListBoxItem In e.Items
		item.Text = "Reordered Item"
	Next
End Sub
````
