# RadDropDownTree Configuration Wizard



The **RadDropDownTree Configuration Wizard** lets you initially configure the RadDropDownTree control at design-time.

To open the Configuration Wizard, simply click the **Open Configuration Wizard** link in the RadDropDownTreeÂ **[Smart Tag]({%slug dropdowntree/design-time/smart-tag%})**.

## DropDown Settings

The **DropDownSettings** tab exposes configuration of some DropDown properties. The tabl allows you to set height and width dimensions, you can set a CSS class, you can set whether its width should be calculated according to the width of the longest item in the DropDown and you can check a box to indicate whether the DropDown should be opened on initial load of the control.

<Comment: Feedback for the programming team. It would be more consistent if the name of the tabs in this control matched with the title above the properties on the right. In some cases (DropDown Properties, Button Settings) they do, in others (General, Filtering Settings, Localization) they do not.>

## Button Settings

The **Button Settings** tab allows you to configure if the ShowCheckAll and ShowClear buttons are going to be displayed.

The **Localization** tab allows you to change the default messages for the buttons embedded within the RadDropDownTree (by default they are "Check All" and "Clear").
