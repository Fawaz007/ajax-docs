## RadDropDownTree Tasks

* **Choose Data Source** lets you change the declarative binding by selecting a data source from a drop-down list of all available data source components. If you select "**\<New Data Source...\>**" the standard Windows [Data Source Configuration Wizard](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms247282(VS.80).aspx) appears, where you can create and configure a data source component. If you select "**(None)**", you remove the existing binding.

* **Open Configuration Wizard** opens the RadDropDownTree Configuration Wizard.



## Ajax Resources

* **Add RadAjaxManager...**: Includes a RadAjaxManager component on the form that allows for fine control over how controls are updated via AJAX.

* **Add ScriptManager**: Includes a ScriptManager, which manages ASP.NET Ajax script libraries and script files, partial-page rendering, and client proxy class generation for Web and application services.

* **Add RadScriptManager**: RadScriptManager performs the same tasks as **ScriptManager** but can also combine all for ASP.NET AJAX JavaScript resources into a single web resource request for better performance.

* **Add RadStyleSheetManager**: The RadStyleSheetManager component enables you to combine all CSS output for ASP.NET AJAX controls into a single stylesheet web resource request.



## Skin

**Skin** lets you select from a list of available [skins]({%slug dropdowntree/appearance-and-styling/skins%}) to customize the look of your **RadDropDownTree**.
